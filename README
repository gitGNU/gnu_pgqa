PostgreSQL Query Analyzer (PGQA) is a major mode to analyze SQL queries for
PostgreSQL database server.

The development is in very early stage now. If you miss any feature, consider
contribution to the project or just check later. If you think you've found a
bug, please report it.

Installation
------------

First, make sure you have GNU Emacs 25 (or later) installed.

Second, copy the pgqa directory to the directory you usually install Elisp
packages into - typically "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pgqa/".

Then add the following lines to the init file of GNU Emacs (adjust load-path
value if you decided to installed the package to a different directory):

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/pgqa/")
(autoload 'pgqa-mode "pgqa" "This function brings buffer to pgqa-mode." t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist (cons "\\.sql\\'" 'pgqa-mode))

Finally restart the GNU Emacs editor. Once you open a file having ".sql"
suffix, major mode of the containing buffer should automatically become
'pgqa-mode.  If the file has different suffix, or if you don't want to modify
'auto-mode-alist, you can use the following command to activate the mode:

	M-x pgqa-mode
